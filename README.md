MIDIPlayer
==========

A custom MIDI player for JHU's Ketzev (http://web1.johnshopkins.edu/ketzev/).

This project uses a slightly modified MIDI.js javascript library (http://mudcu.be/midi-js/) for the javascript midi parsing/playing and a slightly modified DirectoryLister PHP library (http://www.directorylister.com/) for the initial file browser.

Currently, this relys on *.midi files residing in a folder named "drive2".  There are no options to configure this as it was created as a side, niche project for a specific group I am in.

A running version of this project is availible at http://mlbvsnba.no-ip.org/ketzev/
