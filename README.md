MIDIPlayer
==========

Note: This is a a side project of mine and therefore there are no easily accessible options to configure and it's possible that some code (specifically the CSS) could be a bit messy.

A custom MIDI player for [JHU's Ketzev](http://web1.johnshopkins.edu/ketzev/).

This project uses a slightly modified [MIDI.js javascript library](http://mudcu.be/midi-js/) for the javascript midi parsing/playing and a slightly modified [DirectoryLister PHP library](http://www.directorylister.com/) for the initial file browser.

Currently, this relys on *.midi files residing in a folder named "drive2".
